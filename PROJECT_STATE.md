# YsWords — project state

**Read this first when picking the project up.** It records what is true
right now and the traps that have already cost real time. The per-item
work list is `docs/autonomous-queue.md`; this file is the orientation
above it.

Last updated: 2026-08-23.

**The refuter earns its keep — do not drop it to save a turn.** On
2026-08-23 it broke a punctuation repair's stated reasoning twice in one
iteration, in both directions: first it showed eight ASCII quotes should
be converted, then, after the conversion was written, that the population
the argument rested on had been drawn wrong and the conversion had to be
undone. Both times the fix was cheap because nothing had been committed.

## The app

Flutter, six targets: web, iOS, Android, macOS, Windows, Linux. A Bible
study app in Chinese and English — translations, sermons, songs, a
Bible-evidence (archaeology) section, a misconceptions section, and a
featured-video section.

The name is **YsWords** — capital Y, capital W. It lives in five
per-platform places and nothing compared them until
`test/app_display_name_test.dart` did; that test is why it stays right.

## Where each tier is

| Tier | Sites | Version | Rule |
|---|---|---|---|
| dev | `yswords-dev`, `yswords-cn-dev` | **1.4.123** | push freely |
| qat | `yswords-qat`, `yswords-cn-qat` | **1.4.123** | push freely once dev is verified |
| prod | `yswords`, `yswords-cn` | **1.4.11** | ⛔ never without explicit permission **in the current turn** |

**prod is 112 versions behind and it is not an oversight.** Every prod
push needs the user to say so in the moment; permission never carries
over from a previous turn. Full wording of what does and does not count
as permission: `docs/release-policy.md`. prod still serves the broken
LEB and the wrong sermon attribution — those are fixed on dev/qat and
waiting on that one word.

Deploy with `tools/release_web.sh` (auto-bumps, builds, deploys all four
dev/qat sites). Native install: `zsh tools/yswords-ios-reinstall.sh`.

## The autonomous loop

A launchd agent works the queue one item at a time.

- `com.yswords.accuracyloop`, `StartInterval 1800` (every 30 min,
  set by the user 2026-08-23; was hourly), `RunAtLoad false`
- Driver: `~/Library/Application Support/yswords-loop/run.sh`
- Brief: the same directory's `prompt.md`
- Log: the same directory's `run.log`
- `--effort high`; watchdog `MAX_RUN=5400`
- **One item, one agent — no fan-out.** The one exception is the
  refuter, which stays: it guards against confident wrong conclusions,
  which is a different failure from insufficient depth, so raising
  effort does not replace it. It has already caught a wrong ten-row
  video ID table and found 15 verses with missing characters.
- Deploys to dev/qat each iteration when something shipped; never prod.

**Health check:** `tail run.log` — an iteration that ends `rc=0` and
advances the repo hash is healthy.

## Traps that have already bitten

1. **`rm` is on the user's own deny list. Never work around it.** Use
   `mv` to a discard path, or `rmdir` for empty directories.
2. **Never edit `run.sh` in place while it may be running.** bash reads
   a script by byte offset; rewriting it shifts them and the running
   iteration dies with `unexpected EOF`, leaving a stale lock. Write to
   `run.sh.new`, `bash -n` it, then atomic `mv`.
3. **The lock's pid file lives outside the lock directory** so `rmdir`
   alone releases it — a consequence of trap 1.
4. **Rate-limit messages state a reset instant, and it is often already
   past** (the message was written when the run failed). A past instant
   means the limit has lifted — retry now. Rolling it forward waits
   until tomorrow, or, for a dated one, until next year. Both bugs were
   written and caught by test on 2026-08-23; before that the loop woke
   24×/day for three days and failed in ten seconds each time.
5. **Do not write to `/Users/pliu0036/Documents/SeekSparks`.**
6. **`AssetManifest.bin.json` is base64-wrapped binary, not a path map.**
   Grepping it for a filename gives a false negative. Decode it.
7. **`fydt.org` and `www.christiandiscipleschurch.org` refuse datacenter
   IPs** — ECONNREFUSED from this Mac and from GitHub runners alike,
   while the user's phone connects fine. Use YouTube RSS/oEmbed instead
   of scraping those pages. (This Mac is separately behind a Monash
   managed-device stack.)
8. **The `yswords-data` "Refresh songs" daily failure is the audio
   coverage guard working correctly**, not a break. Fix the alert
   fatigue, not the guard.
9. **Data and its test ship together.** Stashing data without its test
   turned four tests red.
10. **The macOS display name is fixed with `CFBundleDisplayName`, never
    `PRODUCT_NAME`** — the latter also names the `.app`, whose path is
    hard-coded in the reinstall script.
11. **A second Claude session shares this checkout and commits blind.** On
    2026-08-23 it ran a blanket `git add` mid-iteration and swept two
    repaired asset files into its own commit. So: stage files by name,
    never `-A` or `.`; check `git status` right before committing; and if
    your work has already landed in someone else's commit, say so in your
    message rather than rewriting theirs. Skip the deploy if `pubspec.yaml`
    or `app_version.dart` is dirty — they are mid-release.
12. **`git checkout <sha> -- <path>` stages as well as restores.** Restoring
    an asset to re-run a repair leaves the index holding the *old* blob, so
    a later `git commit` can quietly commit the pre-repair file. Re-`git add`
    after the tool runs.

## Standing rules from the user

- **經文一定要准确，查经的一定要最高 priority 准确.** Anything where the
  app states something untrue about scripture jumps the queue. An
  interface that looks wrong is annoying; one that reads plausibly and
  is wrong gets believed and quoted.
- **繁體 glyph work is deferred to last** — "fantizi 放在最后 do others
  first", 2026-08-18. This overrides the accuracy rule *for that class
  only*; blank verses, wrong citations and mislabelled translations are
  still P0. What already shipped stays shipped.
- Commits use an Opus 5 `Co-Authored-By` trailer, never another model's.
- Credentials are the user's to handle — including the Xcode Apple ID.

## The queue

`docs/autonomous-queue.md` — 73 open items across P0 (scripture
accuracy), P1 (Bible study correctness), P2 (features the user asked
for), P3 (blocked or deferred).

Largest live threads: the 繁體 glyph class (deferred, ~19 items), URL
routing rework (approved, staged, single-agent only), sermon passage
highlighting with verse-level filtering, seven invalid sermon
references, and an Overlay crash on route pop.

**When closing an item, close the original too.** The loop's habit is to
add an `[x] SHIPPED/SUPERSEDED` entry *above* the open original and
leave the original checked-out; three such duplicates were found on
2026-08-23 and would have made it redo shipped work.

## Blocked on the user — do not attempt

1. **prod deploy** — see above.
2. **貴胄 or 貴冑, and the general rule behind it:** when the printed
   和合本 and modern Traditional orthography disagree, which wins? 26
   places turn on it, and so does every remaining glyph instalment.
3. **NASB licensing** — `assets/nasb.json` is 7.2 MB and publicly
   fetchable from both prod sites. The user's position is that NASB
   needs permission; nothing has been done. Ask before investing in
   anything NASB-shaped.
4. **約翰三書 1:14 versification** and **路加福音 23:34a sub-verse label**
   — editorial choices, not inferences.
5. **Should the 原文 apparatus set its quotes full-width?** 344 ASCII `"`
   per edition, reader-visible wherever notes render. An edition-wide
   typographic choice, not a defect; a sweep tried and was reverted.
