/// Single source of truth for the user-visible app version string.
///
/// Bumped manually in lockstep with `pubspec.yaml`'s `version:` field
/// when shipping a new build. Kept here (not derived from
/// `package_info_plus` at runtime) so the AboutPage footer renders a
/// version even before the package-info plugin has initialised, and
/// so tests can assert against a fixed string.
///
/// 2026-05-07 (v17): extracted from settings_page.dart when the
/// "Check for Updates" tile was removed; AboutPage now surfaces this
/// in its footer.
///
/// 2026-05-07 (v1.0.0 release): bumped to 1.0.0 as the first
/// stable / public-shippable release. This rolls together rounds
/// 54-56 (the post-beta polish cycle) plus the v8-v18 strands of
/// 2026-05-07 (search redesign, feedback pipeline, settings
/// cleanup, and the bug-audit fixes for Timer races / controller
/// leaks / unbounded AI prompt inputs).
///
/// 2026-05-08 (v1.0.1 perf): pure performance patch. Memoized
/// per-verse normalized search keys (collapses every keystroke
/// from O(n × regex chain) to O(n × String.contains)), memoized
/// paragraph grouping + verseToItemMap on MainProvider (was
/// being recomputed on every Consumer rebuild), capped Image
/// decode dimensions on every dashboard / news / evidence /
/// avatar surface (avoids loading 4K source bitmaps for
/// 64 px thumbnails), and dropped the 40 MB `assets/Archived/`
/// folder from the repo (it was never bundled, just bloating
/// clones).
///
/// 2026-05-08 (v1.1.0 — Liquid Glass design pass): translated
/// Apple's WWDC25 Liquid Glass material to Flutter Web. New
/// primitives in `lib/widgets/liquid_glass.dart` (LiquidGlass /
/// LiquidGlassButton / LiquidGlassChip / LiquidGlassCard) compose
/// BackdropFilter blur + translucent fill + specular highlight +
/// hairline border + soft shadows into a single material that
/// catches and refracts whatever sits behind it. High-impact
/// surfaces converted: dashboard quick-links grid, search-page
/// mode chips, welcome-page disclaimer, feedback-form intro.
/// Theme tokens bumped to Apple's iOS 26 shape language: 18 px
/// Card radius, 20 px Dialog radius, San Francisco family at the
/// front of the font fallback chain so macOS / iOS users get
/// native typography out of the box.
///
/// 2026-05-08 (v1.1.1 — material picker): user feedback that v1.1.0
/// glass-everywhere felt worse than the original look. Pivoted to
/// expose the look as one of several pickable materials in
/// Settings → Style preset. Default is Classic (recreates pre-v1.1
/// look). New presets: Liquid Glass, Paper (warm sepia flat),
/// Carbon (dark high-contrast). Backed by a new CardMaterial enum
/// + persisted setting; LiquidGlassButton / LiquidGlassCard now
/// dispatch through the user's choice.
